##
To Do:
- Create branches for test, dev, etc
- Create search feature

## Get Started
``` 
// Run In Terminal
cd my-app
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Important
If you want to add a feature:
- First, create a branch with the name of the feature.
- Develop in there, until you're sure it's working.
- Create a pull request, I'll handle merging it.

This is so we don't go over each other when we're working.

## Guide
Files/Directories you should worry about are ⭐️ed.

### .gitignore
Specifies files and directories for Git to ignore, keeping the repository clean from unnecessary or sensitive data.

### README.md
The `README.md` file provides an overview of the project, including instructions on how to set up, run, and use the application. It serves as the main documentation for the repository, helping users and contributors understand the purpose and functionality of the project.
It's the file you're currently looking at.

### **my-app** ⭐️
The `my-app` folder is the root directory for your TypeScript project. 

#### node_modules
The node_modules directory contains all the modules needed to run this app, you'll see it after running ```npm install```.

#### public
The `public` directory is used to store static assets that will be publicly accessible when the application is built and deployed. 
Eg. robots.txt, apis, etc

#### **src** ⭐️
The `src` directory contains the source code for your application. This is where you will write and organize your TypeScript files, components, and other code modules. It serves as the main workspace for development. 

##### assets
The `assets` directory is used to store images, fonts, and other static resources that are used throughout the application. These assets are typically imported and used within your TypeScript components and stylesheets.

##### App.css
The `App.css` file contains the global styles for your application. It defines the CSS rules that apply to the main components and layout of your app, ensuring a consistent look and feel across the entire application.

##### **App.tsx** ⭐️
The `App.tsx` file is the main component file for your application. It serves as the root component that renders other components and manages the overall structure and routing of the app. This file is typically where you define the main layout and integrate various features and components.

##### index.css
The `index.css` file contains global styles that are applied to the entire application. It typically includes base styles, resets, and common utility classes that are used throughout the app.

##### **main.tsx** ⭐️
The `main.tsx` file is the entry point for your React application. It initializes the React app by rendering the root component (`App.tsx`) into the DOM and sets up any necessary providers or global configurations.

##### vite-env.d.ts
The `vite-env.d.ts` file provides TypeScript type declarations for Vite-specific features. It ensures that TypeScript can understand and provide type checking for Vite's environment variables and other custom features.

#### **index.html** ⭐️
The `index.html` file is the main HTML file for your application. It serves as the entry point for the web application, where the root React component is mounted. This file typically includes the basic HTML structure, meta tags, and links to stylesheets and scripts.

#### eslint.config.js
The `eslint.config.js` file is the configuration file for ESLint, a tool used to identify and fix problems in your JavaScript and TypeScript code. This file defines the rules and settings for linting your codebase, ensuring code quality and consistency.

#### package.json
Package.json is used to define the project's dependencies, scripts, and metadata.

#### package-lock.json
The package-lock.json file is auto-generated by npm to ensure consistent and reproducible builds. It records the exact versions of all dependencies and their sub-dependencies, preventing unwanted updates that could break the project.

#### tsconfig.app.json
The `tsconfig.app.json` file is a configuration file for TypeScript projects. It specifies the root files and the compiler options required to compile the project. It extends the base `tsconfig.json` file and can override or add specific settings for the application build process.

#### tsconfig.json
The `tsconfig.json` file is the base configuration file for TypeScript. It defines the compiler options, file inclusions, and file exclusions for the TypeScript project. This file is extended by other TypeScript configuration files like `tsconfig.app.json` and `tsconfig.node.json` to provide specific settings for different parts of the project.

#### tsconfig.node.json
The `tsconfig.node.json` file is a TypeScript configuration file specifically for Node.js environments. It extends the base `tsconfig.json` file and includes additional settings and compiler options that are optimized for Node.js development and execution.

#### vite.config.ts
The `vite.config.ts` file is the configuration file for Vite, a build tool that provides a faster and leaner development experience for modern web projects. This file includes settings and plugins that define how the project is built and served during development and production.
